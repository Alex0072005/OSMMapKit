# OSMMapKit

OSMMapKit (MapKit for [OpenStreetMap]) is a tiny set of classes (just with a big name, lol) which takes tiles formatted in [MBTiles] SQLite3 database from MapBox and display it on iOS 7 MapKit. In other words, it presents offline map within a pre-defined region on iOS devices.

## Usage

### With MBTiles
~~~
NSURL *tilesURL = [[NSBundle mainBundle] URLForResource:@"SanFrancisco" withExtension:@"mbtiles"];

MBTilesDB *tilesDB = [[MBTilesDB alloc] initWithDBURL:tilesURL];

self.mapView = [[OSMMapView alloc] initWithFrame:self.view.bounds andMBTiles:tilesDB];

[self.view addSubview:self.mapView];
~~~

### Without MBTiles
When used without MBTiles, iOS 7 MapKit already provides the necessary MKTileOverlay to for external map such as Stamen's. The kit only provides additional facilities such as zoom level and map constraint.

## Installation

### CocoaPods
Add this line to `Podfile`
~~~
pod 'OSMMapKit', :git => 'https://github.com/Alex0072005/OSMMapKit.git'
~~~

### Drag library to your project
Drag the project into your directory. In your Build Phases add **libOSMMapKit.a** to "Link binary with libraries".

## Required external dependnecy
[FMDB][FMDB] and Apple's own MapKit

## How to obtain the data source
OpenStreetMap is a mapping project collecting geographical data from collaborators worldwide (For more information, please refer to [OpenStreetMap Wiki]). The data are available as XML files from OpenStreetMap ([OSM data download]). 

To make [MBTiles], a SQLite3 database with a specific schema storing the tile images which OSMMapKit uses, import the data into [PostGis] with either [osm2pqsql] or [Imposm]. The desktop tile-making tool [TileMill] from MapBox can then generate the map tile images from the PostGis database according to [Carto] stylesheet (for starter, try [OSM Bright]) and package them into [MBTiles].

Tutorial is available from MapBox. ([OSM Bright Mac OS X quickstart])

## Known problem (to be fixed)
Tiles around overlay seems to disappear when zoom-in.

### MIT

Code heavily influenced by sources from [MapBox iOS SDK] and [MBXMapKit], as well as various sources, notably [the discussion thread on ZoomLevel] from Troy Brant and input on [constraining the map region] from Anna Karenina.
